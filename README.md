- 👋 Hi, This is @SANTONLAR

- 👀 I’m interested in SQL, Matlab, R Studio; Github; Machine learning tips.

- 🌱 I’m currently working on and reading through material about statistics and econometrics in R and  machine learning techniques
such as regression models, classfication, logistic regression, k-means algorithm and
tree-based models: random forest, neural networks, support vector machines.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on R studio projects. 

- 📫 How to reach me. Just send a Twitt to: @santonlar
